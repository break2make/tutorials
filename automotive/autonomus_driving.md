Functional safety standards, such as ISO 26262, are critical for ensuring that the complex electronics in today’s driver-operated cars are reliably delivering consistent performance over time, without system failures. But, with the emergence of autonomous vehicles, engineers face additional safety challenges. What if components ― sensors, for example ― are working as designed, but are falling short under real-world conditions, creating hazardous conditions?

A new standard, ISO/PAS 21448 (“Road vehicles — Safety of the intended functionality” (SOTIF)), identifies and addresses performance shortfalls in autonomous vehicle systems that occur even in the absence of a system failure. The SOTIF standard raises the safety bar by ensuring that all components (e.g., sensors, perception algorithms) are not only working as designed, but also appropriately designed to perform their intended function under all conditions.
