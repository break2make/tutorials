## Proxy vs Reverse Proxy
In brief, (forward) proxy is used to protect clients while reverse proxy is used to protect servers. Sometimes, reverse proxy is also used as load balancer.

## Load Balancing 
- Objective of load balancing is to distribute the loads instead of sending the request to a single server. 
- Load balancer is a server that forward internet traffic to multiple servers (downstream instances). 
- If one of the downstream server is down, it send the request to another server and hides this fact from the client.
