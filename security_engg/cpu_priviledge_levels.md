# CPU Priveldege Levels

## Why do we even think about CPU priveledge levels?

Modern software expects to be split into different modules, each with a different level of access to system and processor resources. An example of this is the split between the operating system kernel, which has a high level of access to system resources, and user applications, which have a more limited ability to configure the system. 

Most software developers are at least somewhat familiar with the concept of privilege on a computer. For example, the operating system is able to perform operations that are prohibited for processes running in user space. This allows for isolation and protection; a single process is not able to access the memory of another, and a process that crashes does not corrupt the entire system. To enable this model, hardware must offer varying levels of privilege and the ability to move between them.

## What are the ARM privilege/exception levels?

**Exception levels are referred to as EL<x>**

>Note: The architecture does not enforce this software model, but standard software assumes this model.

## What are the RISC-V privilege levels?

RISC-V has three software privilege levels (in increasing order of capability): user-mode (U-mode), supervisor mode (S-mode), and machine mode (M-mode). The processor can run in only one of the privilege modes at a time.

Privilege level defines what the running software can do during its execution. Common usage of each privilege level is as follows:
- U-mode: user processes
- S-mode: kernel (including kernel modules and device drivers), hypervisor
- M-mode: bootloader, firmware

> RISC-V also defines hypervisor priviliege mode (H-mode), but the spec of H-mode is not included in the stable revision (RISC-V Priv. v1.10).
