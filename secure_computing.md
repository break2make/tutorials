# What is secure computing

# Types of secure computing

We can find these phrases:

- **Trusted computing:** in this case, we assume that hardware platform is trusted but the softwares running on the platfrom does not trust each other. This computing paradigm establish a notion of secure world and non-secure world. While the application running on the secure world has access to the entire platfom, the non-secure world applications has limited access. This isolation is done through physical isolation with the support from the underlying hardware.

- **Confidential computing:** This address the secure computing on an untrusted platform. For example, cloud computing platform is an untrusted platform.


We have different type of computing platforms:
- mobile, IoT device, edge device
- desktop, laptop
- cloud

Note that in case of cloud, the hardware platform is owned and managed by cloud provided, and thus, the computing performned on a cloud platform brings bufferent trust challenge. Ideally, we cannot trust a third part platform owner whihle using the platfom for computations of confidential data. We need to have a different technies to address how to perform a secure computing in an untrusted platform.
