# Exploring Automotive




## Open Source Projects

We have listed few open source projects to learn automotiv.

### CARLA
Open-source simulator for autonomous driving research [Link](https://carla.org/)

### AirSim

AirSim is a simulator for drones, cars and more, built on Unreal Engine (we now also have an experimental Unity release). It is open-source, cross platform, and supports software-in-the-loop simulation with popular flight controllers such as PX4 & ArduPilot and hardware-in-loop with PX4 for physically and visually realistic simulations. [more](https://github.com/microsoft/AirSim).

### Vehicle Simulator

The project and the initial software code have been developed by Elements Design Group of San Francisco and the Jaguar Land Rover Open Software Technology Center in Portland, Oregon. The motivation was to provide an open-source, extensible driving simulator project for the development community. While there are multiple potential uses for the application, the primary goal was to create an application to assist in the development and testing of IVI systems related to driver distraction.

### Erika Enterprise RTOS
Erika Enterprise is a royalty free automotive OSEK/VDX certified Hard Real Time Operating System (RTOS). For more details, check [here](http://erika-enterprise.com/).

### SDVOS

SDVOS supports the standard OSEK OS interface. Some AUTOSAR OS extensions such as schedule tables and software timers are also available. To get started, take a look at the tutorials and documentations. For more details, check [here](http://www.sdvos.org/)

### donkeycar

An opensource DIY self driving platform for small scale cars. [Link](https://www.donkeycar.com/) | [Blog](https://opensource.com/article/18/6/galecino-car)

### OpenXC

OpenXC™ is a combination of open source hardware and software that lets you extend your vehicle with custom applications and pluggable modules. It uses standard, well-known tools to open up a wealth of data from the vehicle to developers, even beyond OBD-II. For more details, check [here](http://openxcplatform.com/).
